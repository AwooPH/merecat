Three steps to set up a redirection:
<ol class="Bl-enum">
  <li>Make sure your web server is set up to allow CGI programs.</li>
  <li>Make a symbolic link from the file or directory you want to redirect,
      pointing at this program in the CGI bin directory.</li>
  <li>Add an entry to the file &quot;.redirects&quot; in the directory where
      your http server runs CGI programs. For most servers, this is the
      directory where the given CGI program lives.</li>
</ol>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNTAX"><a class="permalink" href="#SYNTAX">SYNTAX</a></h1>
The format of the .redirects file is a bunch of lines with a filename,
  whitespace, and the new URL. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd">
<pre class="Li">

    /test/oldfile.html    http://www.acme.com/test/newfile.html 

</pre>
</div>
The easiest way to figure out precisely what filename to put into .redirects is
  to set up the symlink and then click on it. You'll get back a &quot;404 Not
  Found&quot; page which includes the filename as received by the redirect
  program, and that's what you want to use.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also add a wildcard specification to redirect whole groups of files. For
  example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd">
<pre class="Li">

    /wildtest/*          http://www.acme.com/test- 

</pre>
</div>
will cause an access to the /wildtest/somefile.html to be redirected to
  http://www.acme.com/test-somefile.html. (Note that the asterisk need not be
  preceded by a slash.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i class="Em" title="Em">Note:</i> <code class="Nm" title="Nm">redirect</code>
  is designed for use with
  <a class="Xr" title="Xr" href="merecat.8.html">merecat(8)</a> and using it
  with other web servers may require some hacking. A possible gotcha is with the
  symbolic link from the old file pointing at this script - servers other than
  thttpd may not allow that link to be run as a CGI program, because they don't
  check the link to see that it points into the allowed CGI directory.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SEE_ALSO"><a class="permalink" href="#SEE_ALSO">SEE
  ALSO</a></h1>
<a class="Xr" title="Xr" href="merecat.8.html">merecat(8)</a>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS_/_DEFICIENCIES"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS_/_DEFICIENCIES">BUGS
  / DEFICIENCIES</a></h1>
It would be really cool to have this program look for the .redirects file in the
  same directory as the file being redirected, instead of in the binaries
  directory. Unfortunately, this appears to be impossible with the information
  CGI gives, plus the non-standardized but widespread practice of running CGI
  programs in the directory where the binary lives. Perhaps CGI 1.2 will address
  this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The wildcard mechanism is very primitive. In particular, any characters that
  follow the asterisk are blithely ignored.
