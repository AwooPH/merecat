Merecat âˆ´ Embedded Web Server
=============================

[Merecat][] started out as a pun at [Mongoose][], but is now useful for
actual web serving purposes.  It is however not a real [Meerkat][],
merely yet another copycat, forked from the great [thttpd][] created by
Jef&nbsp;Poskanzer.

The limited feature set makes it very quick.  This small footprint makes
Merecat suitable for small and embedded systems, even those smaller than
a Raspberry Pi:

- Virtual hosts
- URL-traffic-based throttling
- HTTP/1.1 Keep-alive
- Built-in gzip deflate using zlib
- HTTPS support using OpenSSL

For questions see the included `merecat(8)` man page or the [FAQ][].

Merecat is free software under the simplified 2-clause [BSD license][license].


Authentication
--------------

To protect a directory in your `~USERNAME/public_html/`, create a simple
`.htpasswd` file using the included `htpasswd` tool:

```shell
    user@example:~/> cd public_html/Downloads
    user@example:~/public_html/Downloads/> htpasswd -c .htpasswd friend
	Changing password for user friend
    New password: *****
    Re-type new password: *****
```


Virtual Hosts
-------------

Setting up virtual hosts on a server can be a bit of a hassle with other
web servers.  With Merecat you simply create directories for each host
in the web server root:

```
    /var/www/
      |-- icons/
      |-- cgi-bin/
      |-- errors/
      |    `-- err404.html
      |-- ftp.example.com/
       `- www.example.com/
```

Edit `/etc/merecat.conf`:

```conf
    virtual-host = true
    cgi-pattern = /cgi-bin/*|**.cgi
```

Now the web server root, `/var/www/`, no longer serves files, only
virtual host directories do, execpt for the shared files in `icons/`,
`cgi-bin/`, and `errors/`.

On Linux bind mounts can be used to set up FTP and web access to the
same files. Example `/etc/fstab`:

```
    /srv/ftp  /var/www/ftp.example.com  none  defaults,bind  0  0
```


Optimizing Performance
----------------------

There are many tricks to optimizing the performance of your web server.
One of the most important ones is browser caching.  Merecat supports
both `ETag:` and `Cache-Control:`, however to enable the latter you need
to define the `max-age` setting in `/etc/merecat.conf`:

```conf
    max-age = 3600        # One hour
```

The value is completely site dependent.  For an embedded system you
might want to set it to the maximum value, whereas for other scenarios
you will likely want something else.  By default this is disabled (0).

Another trick is to employ `gzip` compression.  Merecat has built-in
support for serving HTML, CSS, and other `text/*` files if there is a
`.gz` version of the same file.  Here is an example of how to compress
relevant files:

```shell
root@example:~/> cd /var/www/
root@example:/var/www/> for file in `find . -name '*.html' -o -name '*.css'`; do \
      gzip -c $file > $file.gz; done
```

This approach is more CPU friendly than letting Merecat "deflate" files
on the fly, which it otherwise does.


Build Requirements
------------------

Merecat depends on [libConfuse](https://github.com/martinh/libconfuse/)
which, if built from source, by default installs to `/usr/local`.  Non
Debian/Ubuntu systems rarely support this GNU standard, so this is how
you reference it for the Merecat `configure` script:

```shell
user@example:~/merecat/> PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./configure
```

To build Merecat without support for `/etc/merecat.conf`:

```shell
user@example:~/merecat/> ./configure --without-config
```

If you build from GIT sources and not a released tarball, then remember:

```shell
user@example:~/merecat/> ./autogen.sh
```

To install `httpd` into `/usr/sbin/`, default index and icons into
`/var/www`, and config file to `/etc/merecat.conf`:

```shell
user@example:~/merecat/> ./configure --prefix=/usr --localstatedir=/var --sysconfdir=/etc
user@example:~/merecat/> make
user@example:~/merecat/> sudo make install
```

Features
--------

Merecat consists of a front-end, `merecat.c`, and a standalone HTTP
library, `libhttpd.c`, which can be tweaked in various ways and used
for embedding a web server in another applications if needed.

The most common options are available from the `merecat` command line
and the `merecat.conf` configuration file.  Other, less common options,
can be enabled using the `configure` script:

```
    --enable-builtin-icons  Enable built-in icons for dir listings
    --enable-htaccess       Enable .htaccess files for access control
    --enable-htpasswd       Enable .htpasswd files for authentication
    --enable-public-html    Enable $HOME/public_html as ~USERNAME/
    --enable-msie-padding   Enforce padding of httdp error messages
                            sent to Internet Explorer, otherwise it will
                            detect too short msg and display its own.
    --without-config        Disable /etc/merecat.conf support using libConfuse
    --without-ssl           Disable HTTPS support, default: enabled
    --without-zlib          Disable mod_deflate (gzip) using zlib
```

The source file `merecat.h` has even more features that can be tweaked,
some of those are mentioned in the man page, but the header file has
very useful comments as well.
